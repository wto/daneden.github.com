We all design. Every time we evaluate a tool or product, or think about how we might have done something differently, we are designing. I have a tendency to act upon these evaluations.

I believe in <em>stories</em>, not processes. <em>Dialogue</em>, not monologue. <em>People</em>, not users.

Hello. My name is Daniel Eden, and I design and make tools for the web.
