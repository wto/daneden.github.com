Hello. My name is Daniel Eden, and I’m a designer.

I’d like to say I’m also a developer, but I stumble my way through most development projects. Let’s just say that I’m a maker. Right now, I’m studying Digital Media Technology at Nottingham Trent University. I’m in my final year of&nbsp;study.

I grew up in [Manchester](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=manchester&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl), and I’m currently living in [Nottingham](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Nottingham&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=53.479251,-2.247926&amp;sspn=0.263161,0.683212&amp;hnear=Nottingham,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=m&amp;z=12) I’m working hard to find a job I love in [San Francisco](http://racetothestat.es) (but I’ll settle for anywhere in the&nbsp;USA.)

I say a lot of things on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/_dte). I show off my design work-in-progress on [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/dte) You can subscribe to my updates on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/daniel.eden), take a look at my photos on [my photo blog](http://photos.daneden.me/), take a listen to my musical preferences on [Rdio](http://rdio.com/people/daneden), listen to music I’ve made myself on [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/d4te), and endorse me on [Zerply](http://zerp.ly/dte). I also write a lot of code and put it on [GitHub](https://github.com/daneden).

If you want to talk about design, my work, or what I had for breakfast, you can email me at [dan.eden@me.com](mailto:dan.eden@me.com)
