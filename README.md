# daneden.me â€“- Hacker Edition

Welcome to the "Hacker Edition" of [my blog](http://daneden.me). This repo will serve as a playground and development log as I try to migrate the blog from WordPress to Jekyll.

## Why?

I'm a little bored of WordPress. It feels quite bloated for my needs, and plugins (the things that make WordPress so great) happen to be the same thing that makes it so horrible. Static files are faster, and it'll be good to stretch my nerd muscles.

## The Big Differences

There are no images in this repo yet. Featured images are completely missing, and images that are still about are linked from the current blog. As I write this, pages don't work, and it's almost impossible to navigate to a post unless you know the URL.

## Don't hate me

It's all a work in progress. A bit of fun. Watch this space.
