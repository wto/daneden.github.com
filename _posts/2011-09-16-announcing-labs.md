I'm sure a few of you have already poked around the 'labs' directory when I've been posting the occasional demo around the web - but today I'm announcing it's 'official' release to the public.

Nothing much to it really - I upload the odd demo and experiment there, so go and <a title="The daneden.me labs" href="http://daneden.me/labs/">check it out</a>!

The labs are there for a couple of reason really - the main one being so that I can test stuff out in a 'real' world way. Local servers are temperamental, and sometimes I need PHP functionality. Not to mention if I need to use Typekit.

Another big reason is so I can get help and feedback on the stuff I upload there. And finally, I like sharing what I'm doing with others. All the stuff listed there is free to grab and use for yourself.
