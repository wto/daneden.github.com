<blockquote>In a new series of posts where I pick random people that I know, or want to get to know &amp; ask them some questions.

This week, we have <a href="http://daneden.me/" target="_blank">Dan Eden</a>, who describes himself as a web designer and wannabe developer hailing from Manchester, UK. He’s also a student at Nottingham Trent University, studying Digital Media Technology.

Dan is an avid <a href="http://forrst.com/people/de" target="_blank">Forrst</a> user and the guy that brought us, amongst other useful things, <a href="http://brills.me/" target="_blank">Brills</a> &amp; <a href="http://daneden.me/animate/" target="_blank">Animate.css</a>. Here he answers my questions about himself, his work, his future and a few other things in between.</blockquote>
