It's almost <a href="http://daneden.me/2011/11/looking-ridiculous-for-charity/" title="Looking ridiculous for charity">that time of the year</a> again - Movember is upon us! Yes, that's right ladies, the world (or at least the U.K.) is going to be choc-a-block full of gentlemen struggling to grow moustaches in the name of charity. Specifically, fighting testicular cancer.

I'm taking part again this year, but in a slightly unconventional way. Due to prior engagements in the month of November that require my face to be clean shaven, I'll be taking half my moustache-growing in the second half of October, and the other half in the first half of November.

You can (and should) <a href="http://mobro.co/dte">donate right away</a>. It's for a good cause, and you'll get to see me looking ridiculous once again.

Missed that link the first time? <a href="http://mobro.co/dte">Here it is again</a>. Go and donate! Forget that coffee you've been looking forward to on your morning commute and shift the money to a better cause. Every little helps.

Many thanks in advance.
