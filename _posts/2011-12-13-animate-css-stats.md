Statistics! Everyone loves statistics. It's been exactly 2 months since I first unleashed Animate.css to the world.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">What's that? A bunch of classy CSS animations, prewritten and free? You got it, buster. <a title="http://daneden.me/animate/" href="http://t.co/K6YokRhw">daneden.me/animate/</a>

<!--more-->I'm going to jump right in to the good stuff, but first I need to clarify two things:
<ul>
	<li>The number of downloads hasn't been tracked. This is for a couple of reasons, mainly because I saw that you couldn't tell how many times it had been downloaded from Github, so recording ~50% of the downloads through the build tool would have been a little bit pointless</li>
	<li>The analytics haven't been active the whole time - they were only activated a day before <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Andy Clarke</a> was due to mention it on stage at <a href="http://aneventapart.com/">An Event Apart</a> (24th October)</li>
</ul>
With that in mind, let's get some numbers. These are the stats for the time of writing (9:00am 13th December 2011):
<ul>
	<li>In just 6 weeks, Animate.css got more visits than daneden.me has in an entire year - over 20,000 views</li>
	<li>To date, Animate.css has had:
<ul>
	<li>42,960 visits</li>
	<li>30,264 unique visitors</li>
	<li>55,281 pageviews</li>
	<li>And on it's busiest day, 3,616 pageviews</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>On Github, the Animate.css repo has:
<ul>
	<li>1,608 watchers</li>
	<li>151 forks</li>
	<li>88 commits</li>
	<li>21 issues (15 resolved)</li>
	<li>4 pull requests</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Tweets from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/smashingmag/status/146333659497107457">Smashing Magazine</a>, Andy Clarke, Web Design Tuts+, and others receiving 50+ retweets and favorites*</li>
	<li>Found on <a href="http://foursquare.com">Foursquare</a>'s home page</li>
</ul>
So, quite a lot of attention for my little project really. To think this all came from a simple animation I wrote for Brills and has become so popular is still so surreal. A massive thank you to everyone who has supported, contributed, shared, and enjoyed Animate.css so far.

<small><em>*Twitter only says "50+ RT's/favorites" so I'm not sure what the actual number is. And if anyone can find the permalinks to Andy &amp; Web Design Tuts+' tweets, I'd be very grateful!</em></small>
