It's not very often I find myself cooped up inside on a Friday night (wait, who am I kidding?), but when I am, I like to get creative and make something. Usually it's a throwaway design, or just a little Photoshop practice, but this time I decided to make something a little more exciting. <a href="http://daneden.me/type">Just My Type.</a>

I'd long wanted to create something of a library for myself that kept a record of all the great web font combinations I'd come across, or created myself, as well as color combinations for websites. Since I had a Typekit account, I thought it'd be fun to make something 'real' - more than just a static image, sitting on my computer. So I made<a href="http://daneden.me/type"> Just My Type.</a>

So far, the response has been great. People love it! And I find it useful, which is all it was really meant to achieve. Right now, there are nine combinations, including five contributed by other people.

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://daneden.me/type"><img class=" wp-image-1307 aligncenter" title="Just My Type" src="http://daneden.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Just-My-Type.png" alt="" width="918" height="1261" /></a></p>

I hope the suggestions keep coming, and I hope that Just My Type becomes useful to other designers as the collection increases in size. Expect more features and combinations over the next few days!
