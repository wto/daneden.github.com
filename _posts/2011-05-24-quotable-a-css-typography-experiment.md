I've been seeing a lot more of the typographic world recently - notably, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/LUKESBEARD" target="_blank">Luke Beard</a>'s fantastic posters have been catching my eye, and I was introduced to the work of <a href="http://www.behance.net/BenCrick/frame" target="_blank">Ben Crick</a>. While I know I'm no typographic master, I wanted to contribute something to this fine art in a medium I felt comfortable working with (I'm terrible at drawing, especially typefaces, and Photoshop's text rendering is laughable).

My contribution comes in the form of another CSS experiment that I call <em><a href="http://daneden.me/labs/quotable/" target="_blank">Quotable</a></em>. The fonts are served by <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts" target="_blank">Google Web Fonts</a>, a service I use exhaustively on my own site and on most of the sites I create these days. I also put in some nice animations for Webkit users.

Go ahead and <a href="http://daneden.me/labs/quotable/" target="_blank">play away</a>. If I had more time I'd have made several more quotes that users can click through, but that would have involved copious amounts of Javascript that I'm not too comfortable with.
