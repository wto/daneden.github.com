The second CSS experiment this week - and it's also a quick look into the tools I use every day in my design process.

I won't go too much into the code this time, but you can go and have a look at it in action <a title="Tools of the trade" href="http://daneden.me/labs/tools" target="_blank">right here</a>. It's only been tested in Google Chrome so far, but it should work in Firefox, Safari and Opera just fine. Non-webkit browsers don't get lovely glowing animation, and I have no idea what Internet Explorer has to say about all of this.

Any suggestions or browser test results would be appreciated in the comments!
