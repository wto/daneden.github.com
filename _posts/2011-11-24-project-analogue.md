I've set myself a little challenge. Every day, for as long as I can keep it up, I'm going to write something.

I started just yesterday, in an attempt to improve my childlike handwriting. But already, after just two voyages into my Moleskine, I'm reaping benefits greater than I had anticipated. It's as if a calm has come over me. It feels wonderful to work on something outside of the digital realm - even if it's just a page or two of poor handwriting. It also gives me an hour or so to properly step away from my desk, my phone, and everything else to just concentrate.

Project Analogue - write something, every day.
