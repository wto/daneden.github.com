Some of you are more than familiar with the relatively popular CSS animation library I recently built, <a href="http://daneden.me/animate">animate.css</a>.

For those who aren't let this post serve as an introduction. <a href="http://daneden.me/animate">Animate.css</a>Â is a plug-and-play CSS3 animation library, with over 40 prewritten animations ready to use in your website. It's built to work on the latest Safari, Google Chrome, Firefox and iOS devices.

Work is well underway for a Javascript based fallback for older browsers, and it's been prepared for the future with the addition of Microsoft-specific rules (for Internet Explorer 10, which has promised animation support) as well as the non-prefixed W3C standard. If you end up using it in a project, I'd love to hear from you.

The library has also earned me some bragging rights - it's had over 1000 tweets to date, over 500 watchers on Github, and it's been mentioned by the wonderful <a href="http://smashingmagazine.com">Smashing Magazine</a> and featured in the <a href="http://thinkvitamin.com">Think Vitamin</a> newsletter.

If you want to learn more about the ins and outs and the how-to's with animate.css, I wrote a blog post for the Dundee Web Standards group, which you can read <a href="http://dundeewebstandards.com/post/9/css-powered-slider-with-animate-css/">here</a>.
