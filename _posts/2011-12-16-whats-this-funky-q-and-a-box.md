It's the latest addition to my blog.

Around 50% of the visits this website receives are through search engines. About 50% of those search queries are questions. The vast majority of those questions aren't answered here on my blog - at least not directly (and I know how frustrating it is going through search results that almost answer your question, but not quite).

This "Question and Answer" series will attempt to answer the common and interesting questions that point to my website. For the questions I can't answer myself, I'll invite other people to help answer them, or you can feel free to leave a comment if you feel I've answered it incorrectly.

It's just a bit of social interaction, and hopefully it'll be a bit of fun-ducation, too!
