I've recently been spending a lot of time with the Ubuntu operating system. My previous experiences with Linux had been somewhat overshadowed by hard drive failures, driver hunting and command-line hell, so I was determined to get it right this time. So far (about 3 months after originally installing Ubuntu on my old 3-boot PC) I've not hit anything particularly scary, so I've had time to really appreciate Ubuntu for what it's worth.

My first impressions of Ubuntu were very positive indeed - gone, it seemed, were the days of hunting for drivers and endless terminal windows. The UI was sexy, the support was outstanding - so far, (just like my iMac) everything just worked. It was beginning to look like a real contender for my every day operating system.

So I grabbed the beta release of Chrome, got my gwibber set up and started playing. No errors or scary terminals at all. I was starting to take it a little more seriously than in previous experiences. I grabbed filezilla and teamed it with gedit to play with Perlsy - which was fantastic. And to this day I still prefer gedit to any other text editor.

And this is where things went a little downhill. I've never been a big fan of gimp, and now I was somewhat of a convert, I knew I'd have to deal with it again. To my disappointment, it hadn't been transformed into Photoshop or adapted it's UI, so I continued to struggle.

I also found that any software that wasn't in the software centre involved a ridiculous amount of work for the user in the command line, putting even me out of my comfort zone.

Overall I'd say that Ubuntu is a first class choice for people who only use their computers for simple browsing and writing, but anything more than that will probably require a fair amount of work and effort from the user.

That's not going to stop me from trying though!
