I've found that one of the skills people see in Web/graphic designers is the ability to use Adobe Flash. To their surprise, I tell them that I don't use flash in my work if I can avoid it. I've never really had long enough to answer the 'why?' that often follows, so I'll take the opportunity to answer it now.

<!--more-->It wasn't that long ago that I spent all my time on websites like Miniclip and Newgrounds, searching for a good game to play. They were made in Flash, a technology I simply couldn't understand - so naturally, I couldn't wait to use it.

At first I was bewildered and just couldn't get anything to happen, so I gave up and left it to the experts. And to be frank, I'm glad I didn't put the effort in. A few years later I really started getting into web design, and it seemed as if I'd have to return to flash. Luckily, around the same time, an awful lot of ruckus was being made about CSS3 with enhancements such as transitions and animations, as well as Javascript frameworks such as jQuery and Mootools making previously complex scripting easier for newbie developers.

I decided to hold back until I knew more about the pros and cons of flash vs these new technologies. The things I learnt were important lessons. I found through personal experience that flash sites are hard to navigate, they aren't accessible, they won't work on devices such as the iPhone, anything with more than a few simple pages requires an uninformative loading screen, and it's pretty hard just to make something move across the screen.

These problems quickly weighed up and I finally decided to scrap learning flash. I put a lot of my effort into learning the ins and outs of Â CSS3 and it paid off. I can say with pride that after spending minutes coding a simple animation that would have taken me hours with flash, I let out a loud sigh of relief and give myself a nice pat on the back.

If Flash were an open technology that the majority of emerging platforms continued support for, then things would be different - but I for one am happy to embrace things like CSS3 and HTML5 and say fare well to closed platforms.
