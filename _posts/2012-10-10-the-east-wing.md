I had the great honour of being a guest on <a href="https://twitter.com/timothybsmith">Tim Smith</a>'s podcast, <a href="http://theeastwing.net/episodes/29-dan">The East Wing</a>. Tim gave me a chance to talk about my side projects, and go into more detail about the ideas I spoke about in my <a href="http://daneden.me/2012/10/things-id-teach-my-younger-self-pt-2/" title="Things I'd Teach My Younger Self, Pt. 2">last blog post</a>.

<a href="http://theeastwing.net/episodes/29-dan">Go take a listen</a>.

While you're listening, you should support Tim's <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timothybsmith/make-awesome-magazine">Make Awesome project on KickStarter</a>. Make Awesome sounds like it'll be a great publication, but only with the support of the web community. Help a brother out!
