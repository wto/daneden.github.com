I've been on a bit of a CSS3 high recently, and as a result I've got 2 new css experiments for you to take a look at. The CSS code is all in the head of the html file so no external linking, it just calls on one file per demo.

Here they come:
<ul style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
	<li><a title="CSS-only iTunes logo" href="http://madebyeden.co.uk/poi/css3itunes">iTunes logo in CSS</a> (only works in Webkit browsers for now)</li>
	<li><a title="CSS-only buttons" href="http://madebyeden.co.uk/poi/css3buttons">CSS-only buttons</a> (and it looks alright in IE too!)</li>
</ul><br>
Enjoy!
