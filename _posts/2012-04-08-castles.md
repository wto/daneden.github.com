Let me get one thing straight - I'm not exactly what you'd call "outdoorsy". I hated boy scouts, despised <abbr title="Physical Education. I'm not quite ready to start calling it 'gym class'">P.E.</abbr> in high school; I'm still not sure I fully understand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)">the offside rule.</a> But there's something quite special about stepping away from they keyboard and making something, or going somewhere. Smelling the Earth. Getting dirt in your fingernails, and building a <em>thing</em> you can take home and use.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1290" title="HUF Haus" src="http://daneden.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/960x400_HUF-Haus-ART-6-grau_aussen1.jpg" alt="" width="954" height="397" />

My (unlikely) dream is to one day get myself a prefabricated, flat-pack house, much like the one you see above from <a href="http://www.huf-haus.com/en/home.html">HUF Haus</a>, and put it up somewhere nice. Something I can call my own - completely new. Something I know from the inside out. My own custom castle.

Of course, I know I could never do it alone - I don't have the manpower to build such a thing on my own, nor the brainpower to figure out things like plumbing and electricity. Maybe if I put my mind to it I could, but <a href="http://bukk.it/noidea-golf.gif">I doubt it.</a> But the intention is there, and I'd supervise the whole thing, and it would still be that - <em>my</em> castle. And I could sure as hell decorate the thing, and put up the shelves myself, and maybe even build a table and a few whatchamacallits.
<h2>Where exactly are you heading with this, Dan?</h2>
Good question. I feel very much the same way about my future as I do about design &amp; web development. I feel like we should be making our own tools, and our own crutches, rather than using whatever the hottest thing right now is. When I needed a CSS framework, I found that the currently available solutions didn't suit my needs - so <a href="http://daneden.me/toast">I made one.</a> When I found myself repeatedly writing the same CSS animations on websites, I thought to myself "There must be a place with all this stuff already written?" - and there wasn't. So <a href="http://daneden.me/animate">I made one.</a> When I needed a place to calculate my income and outgoings, I found there were a few places to go. But they were all way to complex or expensive. So... <a href="http://brills.me">you guessed it.</a>

Even if a solution already exists, we should strive to make something else. Because it's fun. It's hard work. It's practice. It could be invaluable to others. What defines a product's success, to me, is not how well it is received by others, but how happy you are with it.

Don't settle for a house someone else has built - strive for a castle you crafted. Make things.
