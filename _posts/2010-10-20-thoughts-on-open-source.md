A few days ago, Apple CEO Steve Jobs had a phone call about Google's Android platform vs iOS. He essentially argued that the Android platform lacked in quality and standards that iOS apps didn't.

This got me thinking about open source programs in general. Now I've tried to enjoy Mozilla firefox many times, but like many open source programs, I find it feels like there are many loose ends. It simply doesn't feel as put together as say Safari. Chrome is based on open standards, and it feels great - I'd consider it the exception to the rule.

Ubuntu is fantastic. It loads and runs quickly, it's perfect for development and it's got a hell of a lot of available software. But when I'm using it, it feels like the user has a lot of work to do. Many drivers aren't installed by default, errors crop up, just feels loose-ended again.

In regards to mobile platform, I'd have to side for Apple. Android is great, but like Steve Jobs says, it lacks in quality of build. I have an iPhone 3G, and it's getting pretty rusty, but still find it more intuitive and stable than my friends top-notch android.

At the end of the day, "closed" platforms, in my experience tend to be worth the extra cost.
