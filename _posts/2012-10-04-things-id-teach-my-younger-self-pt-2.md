A little over a year ago, I wrote <a href="http://daneden.me/2011/07/things-id-teach-my-younger-self/">a post</a> describing some of the lessons I'd teach my younger self if I could go back in time. Generally speaking, there's not much technical knowledge I'd add to that post (except <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2011/09/when-using-ids-can-be-a-pain-in-the-class/">don't use IDs in CSS</a>) - all those things are second nature to me now.

So here I am, thinking of other things I've learnt over the last 12 months that I would tell myself. But I don't want to talk about technical doodads or CSS7 or version control. I want to talk about emotion, and experience, and design. The things that have made a bigger impact in the last 12 months.

<ul>
<li><strong>Everything will be OK in the end. If it's not OK, it isn't the end.</strong> Someone told me this while I was in <a href="http://daneden.me/i-have-no-idea-what-im-doing">Helsinki</a>, and I've thought about it every day since. Generally speaking, I'm quite a nervous person, but this little bit of advice calms me down right away.</li>
<li><strong>People care about what you have to say.</strong> That's why I blog. Even if what I say is wrong, there's bound to be someone out there who likes reading it - or at least wants to take the time to show you how you can be better. And while we're on the subject...</li>
<li><strong>You can do better.</strong> I skimmed right past this bit of advice in <a href="http://shop.frankchimero.com">Frank Chimero's book</a> until a <a href="http://twitter.com/iamemliy">beautiful girl</a> pointed it out to me. Again - it hasn't left my mind since.</li>
<li><strong>It's OK to suck.</strong> You'll get better. Be patient. Reach out to the people you think are better than you for help - don't just waddle in a pit of self loathing and envy. They sucked too.</li>
<li><strong>Everything is designed.</strong> This was the mind explosion for me. When I said that sentence in my head for the first time, everything became clear in a way I hadn't experienced before. Everything is designed. I mean everything. Someone made a choice about the shape of your mug. The width of your desk. The weight of the coins in your pocket.</li>
</ul>

As usual, I'm sure I'm missing some things I'd teach myself, but that's not the point. There's always room for more, (see bullet point #3) and with any luck I'll look back on this in a year's time and still believe in it.
