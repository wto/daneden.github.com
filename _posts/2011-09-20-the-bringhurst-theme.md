<mark>This post is referring to an old blog design that is no longer in use. Sorry about that.</mark>

<a href="http://daneden.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/infographic.png"><img class="span_all aligncenter size-full wp-image-765" title="Bringhurst's Media Queries" src="http://daneden.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/infographic.png" alt="" width="796" height="366" /></a>That's right folks, another redesign. You must be getting sick of it. But this one's a goodun, and I'll tell you why.

I've recently been investing a lot more time and money into learning. More specifically, learning through books. In the last few months, I've read more books than I did during the entire first 2 years of University. Specifically, Robert Bringhurst's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0881792063/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=danedesblo-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0881792063">The Elements of Typographic Style</a>, Elliot Jay Stocks' <a href="http://8faces.com/">8faces</a> (not a book, but a great read nontheless - issue #3), Erin Kissane's <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/the-elements-of-content-strategy">Elements of Content Strategy</a>Â and Ellen Lupton's <a href="http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/">Thinking With Type</a>. You might notice a theme throughout those books - they're all teaching typographic principles and writing skills.

<h2>Typography</h2>
<aside>
<blockquote class="huge_pull">I put down my brush and folded my arms, and slowly became aware of all the holes I'd neglected to fill.</blockquote>
</aside>

Many of the ideas presented in these books are the basis for the new theme. I wanted to make something incredibly readable, thoughtfully designed and <a href="http://prandall.com/2009/10/13/good-design-is-invisible/">invisible</a>. The more I look at my <a title="Nostalgia" href="http://daneden.me/old/">old theme</a>, the more I realise all the silly mistakes I'd made. The body type, while readable, wasn't really very <em>nice</em>. There were strange single-pixel oddities as the side of the page, where the background seeped through the faux column. The stylesheet was starting to get messy.

I was also becoming more aware of generic practices that I'm (apparently) still getting the hang of - contrast, white space, vertical rhythm. Things I thought I'd done well in the last theme, but the reality was that I was still learning. I put down my brush and folded my arms, and slowly became aware of all the holes I'd neglected to fill.

I wanted the typographic style of the theme to mirror that of Bringhurst's book. A generous line-height, simpler headings, and aside elements give me plenty of flexibility in my posts. Pull quotes are much nicer. A more classical, old-style typeface is used throughout the site. At first, I was just going to work with the one typeface (Adobe Caslon Pro), but a nice expanded Gothic typeface (Alternate Gothic N0. 3) compliments the serif face nicely and helps to divide the page up.
<h2>Layout</h2>
The site basically has 3 common layouts - 5 columns, 3 columns, 1 column. They're demonstrated in the picture at the top of this post. On large screens, single posts are divided into 2 large columns. Below 1224px, it snaps down to one column. Then on narrow screens below 775px, the whole page snaps down to a single column.

[caption id="attachment_772" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="See? 5 columns."]<a href="http://daneden.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/grid1.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-772" title="The grid. A digital frontier." src="http://daneden.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/grid1-1024x637.png" alt="" width="640" height="398" /></a>[/caption]

Vertical rhythm is more or less maintained as much as possible throughout the site. Not a single pixel value is used to my knowledge (except when accounting for borders and whatnot). The whole width is measured in ems, as are the margins, line-heights, font sizes and everything else under the sun. I don't really get on all that well with <a title="Stop using pixels!" href="http://forrst.com/posts/Stop_using_pixels-vy1">pixels</a>.

Oh, and I stripped out the footer and sidebar. The sidebar wasn't really all that useful, it was mainly there for aesthetics. And the footer had very little real content, most of which can now be found on my about page.
<h2>Errors</h2>
There are likely to be a lot of broken pages. Simply put, I was too excited to leave this theme lying around any longer - I wanted to show the world. I'd be grateful if you let me know if any pages looks off, or if something breaks on the site. The best way to test a design, in my experience, is by using it. Things like Art Direction on the posts that have it have been disabled while I iron everything out. However, Art Direction might stay turned off for this theme. While it's a great tool, an awful lot of thought &amp; practice has gone into this theme - there's a risk of it going a bit funny with per-post styles.

That just about sums it up. If you like it, give me a <a href="http://twitter.com/_dte">shout</a>. If you hate it, write me a polite letter.
