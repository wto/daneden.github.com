Many designers strive for feedback - they use sites like <a title="My Dribbble profile" href="http://dribbble.com/daneden/">Dribbble</a> and <a title="My profile on Forrst" href="http://forrst/com/people/de/">Forrst</a>, and even <a title="My twitter profile. Tweet!" href="http://twitter.com/dan_eden">Twitter</a> to show off their latest creations, receive feedback and criticism. But what a lot of them forget to do is provide feedback themselves, or even reply to the feedback they receive from the community. Unfortunately, there are some people who piggyback off the community, getting feedback when they wish but neglecting to recognise it or to contribute their thoughts to the work of others.

I for one try to get back to every single person who leaves valid or helpful criticism. Now, when you've got just a few followers who look out for you and give you some feedback, that's easily manageable. But let's say you post something on Dribbble, and you get a ridiculous amount of feedback. Some good, some bad, but there's a lot of it.

But how can I possibly respond?"]<img class="size-full wp-image-580" title="Popular (but fictional) post on Dribbble" src="http://daneden.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dribbbble.png" alt="Popular (but fictional) post on Dribbble" width="315" height="160" />[/caption]

Don't worry, my posts aren't nearly as popular on Dribbble. But what could you do? It would be silly to reply to each comment. Perhaps send some twitter shout-outs thanking people, or reply to the comments you found particularly useful. Forrst has done a great job by allowing users to vote for helpful comments - at the cost of a few acorns, the 'currency' employed on the site.

If you're going to ask for feedback, be sure to involve yourself in the wider community. Find other people looking for feedback, let others know if they're doing a good job, and most importantly be sure to thank the people who have helped you!
