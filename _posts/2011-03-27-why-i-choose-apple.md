I recently moved back to Manchester from Nottingham for the Easter break, bringing my iMac home with me. Not long after I got home I realised I had to go back to Nottingham later that week to do some work for <a href="http://perlsy.info" target="_blank">Perlsy</a> with the rest of the team (later cancelled - my fault!). So I got on the train (without my Mac) and came back.

Since almost all the work I do these days is on the web, and is therefore on servers or on my USB for local testing, I had no doubts that the weekend would be pretty smooth. Turns out my old Windows desktop at university is not as reliable as I had remembered, and it gave me a chance to re-evaluate why I decided to get a Mac.

<!--more-->The first thing I noticed when I opened up the windows PC (which I usually only use for 3Ds Max and UDK) was that I kept finding myself thinking of really easy things to do with my Mac, which were herculean tasks with my PC. I had no music on the pc, so I decided to install Spotify, which led to me installing drivers for the wireless card, which meant going on the internet, which meant downloading the drivers on another pc etc... You can see my frustration.

Also, when I'm on my Mac, I don't find myself waiting for very long, for anything. For some reason, installing anything on Windows involves opening, waiting, rebooting, waiting some more, following instructions, then waiting for the program to actually work. This was my first headache out of the way, however, and I was ready and willing to crack on. Now, I like to work with something playing in the background, like an episode of House or Family Guy, so naturally, while I was waiting for Filezilla to do some ftp wizardry, I opened up a new window and got House playing in the background. TheÂ dulcet tones of Hugh Laurie did indeed relax me, but at a cost. Using any kind of Flash or JS-heavy site in Chrome made the whole computer slow to an unbearable level. To make matters worse, my attempts to unzip a folder only 22mb in size resulted in disk read/writes of about 11kb/s - modem internet is faster than that. Guess how long it took to unzip the same folder on my Mac? 2 seconds.

In general, the interface for Windows is obtrusive, unhelpful and unintuitive. Simple tasks like unzipping a folder come with 3 seperate windows - layered windows, which appear as separate ones in the window switcher, but you can't close any of them without cancelling the task at hand!

While I was downloading Ubuntu so I could actually get some work done, I thought about why I use Apple's products - and it's a simple answer. It's fun. I enjoy using my iMac because it's elegant and intuitive, it's easy to use... heck, I don't have to worry about disk defragmentation, install wizards, drivers, any of that stuff. As Apple have said themselves, it just works. And the same applies to all of their products.
