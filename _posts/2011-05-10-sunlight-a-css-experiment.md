I'm getting good at cranking these out - here's another CSS experiment! It's a simple one - hover over the page and it changes from day to night, with some animation and transitions along the way. Once again, no iOS support (it's hard to support hover events on touch based devices) but works well in webkit browsers and should work OK in other browsers too, except IE.

I have no doubt that some of the methods used here are a bit funny and there are much better ways to achieve the same effect, but you get the idea. It's not for production, just for fun.<!--more-->

Things that are in CSS:
<ul>
	<li>The sun</li>
	<li>The moon</li>
	<li>The sky</li>
	<li>The stars</li>
	<li>The animations (work in webkit only)</li>
	<li>The transitions (only tested in webkit)</li>
</ul>
The hills and the clouds are images, but other than that it's all CSS wizardry.
