<mark>This post is referring to an old blog design that is no longer in use. Sorry about that.</mark>

Regular visitors to the site will notice something new today - a brand spanking new layout and theme. A lot of work has gone in to make it as simple, fast loading and functional as possible, and I'm going to talk about some of the main new features.

 


<!--more-->
The first thing you'll notice is the new color scheme. It's much more simple, minimalistic and readable. I think that reading posts should be as pleasurable and distraction-free as possible and this simple theme lends itself to that cause.

The next thing you'll probably notice is the layout - the header is now over there to the left. Yes, header, not sidebar. But it behaves like a sidebar, I hear you say? Wrong. Resize the window or visit the site in a mobile browser and you'll see it snap up to the top. The whole site is completely fluid from 1140px wide all the way down to a mobile version thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/andytlr" target="_blank">Andy Taylor's</a> fantastic <a href="http://cssgrid.net" target="_blank">CSS Grid</a>. This is called responsive web design, and as time drifts by more and more people are using iPhones, Droids and tablets to browse the web - it's only fitting if I accommodate for this audience. Try changing the windows size now, or take a look at the pictures:

[caption id="attachment_285" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="The big screen view for the site"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-285" title="Large View" src="http://daneden.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-Shot-2011-03-13-at-14.03.43-300x201.png" alt="" width="300" height="201" />[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_286" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="The slightly trimmed medium size view"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-286" title="Medium view" src="http://daneden.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-Shot-2011-03-13-at-14.04.03-300x272.png" alt="" width="300" height="272" />[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_287" align="aligncenter" width="135" caption="The skinny mobile layout"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-287" title="Mobile" src="http://daneden.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-Shot-2011-03-13-at-14.04.20-135x300.png" alt="" width="135" height="300" />[/caption]

Some other things you might not notice are HTML5 semantic elements. Using new elements like article, section, time etc have helped give the site semantic meaning as well as reducing the number of classes and specific CSS rules for numerous div tags. Loading times have been dramatically improved by completely removing all the images (only 2 images in the images folder - one for the favicon at a tiny 2kb and another for the jQuery plugin at 800 bytes) and by moving js scripts to the bottom of the page.

Another little difference is the use of the <a href="http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/tipsy/" target="_blank">Tipsy</a> jQuery plugin, for a little extra user experience on certain links.

Overall, I think it's a much better design and with promise to become even better in the future.
