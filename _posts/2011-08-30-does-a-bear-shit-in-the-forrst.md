It's no secret that I love <a href="http://forrst.com">Forrst</a> - it's my number one resource for tips, tricks and inspiration in my web design &amp; development. It's a truly great website, and it's understandable why so many people want in.

Forrst has an invite system, whereby members have the opportunity to invite other people, or vote for prospective members to be invited. They aren't <a href="http://dribbble.com">alone</a> in this system, and I think it's a good one that helps moderate the quality of work that comes in.

So as well as inviting people manually by giving Forrst their email address, members can vote for new people to come in too. These prospective members are given the opportunity to provide their name, twitter handle, something they've made (more often than not, it's their own website) and finally - and most importantly - they leave feedback on a post on Forrst. This is the part that usually goes tits-up.

<!--more-->Now the majority of feedback left on these posts is pretty good and thorough. One such example reads like this:
<blockquote>"Great execution of work. The text in the background is clearly readable. Although I would probably have changed the way that the twitter, facebook and youtube icons look. You want the viewer's attention to focus on sharing the content - so maybe add some color?"</blockquote>
This is a perfect example of decent feedback. It could be more thorough, but the important parts are there. Encouragement, criticism, and suggestion.

The following is a list of real "feedback" found on invitation pages. They are truly awful, and people who do this on Forrst are simply not getting in.
<blockquote>"Simply the best !!!"

"I think it's a good tutorial"

"Hello I decided to enroll on Forrst because I think it's a springboard for what has become known in the wonderful world of design" - <strong>You're leaving feedback, not a reason to invite you</strong>

"very nice design, clear..."

"Wordpress is the best!" - <strong>um. Why?</strong>

"Hello! the Zen." - <strong>This just doesn't make any sense.</strong>

"I love it's cool"

"Hi"

"i want to learn more"

"i'd really like to join in Forrst with the purpose to share my knowledge"

"Fine"</blockquote>
I can't stress how much this bothers me (and I'm sure it bothers the founders of the site, too). Please, please, if you are trying to join Forrst, or any other site with a similar joining process, just bear some things in mind:
<ul>
	<li><strong>This is an interview. </strong>You wouldn't say to a potential employer something like "lol i like the colors, they look pretty &lt;3". Forrst has the potential to launch your career, so don't treat it like MSN messenger.</li>
	<li><strong>Paradoxically, this is not an interview. </strong>Don't tell us why you want to share your knowledge or how long you've dreamt of joining in the fun - we know how much you want in. Just show us how well you can pull apart a post and comment effectively on it.</li>
	<li><strong>Be thorough. </strong>While it's nice to hear that someone likes your design, three word comments are far from useful. Leave the compliments to the 'likes', and be thorough in your criticism. If you like it, tell us why. If you don't, tell us what we can do to improve it.</li>
	<li><strong>If you don't have work you can be proud of, don't show it.</strong>Â I hope I'm not offending anyone by saying this, but there's a lot of crappy design floating around on Forrst. It's hard to moderate, and it's even harder to maintain a high standard of quality on a website where people go to learn. But nevertheless, you will know yourself whether or not a high level of effort has been put into a design or a post. This goes for showing us something you've made - if you don't have anything good to show, don't show anything.</li>
</ul>
